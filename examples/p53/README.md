p53 overview
------------

According to Wikipedia,
p53 (also known as protein 53 or tumor protein 53),
is a tumor suppressor protein that in humans is encoded
by the TP53 gene.
p53 is crucial in multicellular organisms,
where it regulates the cell cycle and, thus,
functions as a tumor suppressor that is involved in preventing cancer.

In humans, p53 is encoded by the TP53 gene located on the short arm
of chromosome 17 (17p13.1).
The gene spans 20 kb, with a non-coding exon 1 and a very long first
intron of 10 kb.
The coding sequence contains five regions showing a high degree
of conservation in vertebrates, predominantly in exons
2, 5, 6, 7 and 8.
