"""
Functions related to a Markov process in discrete time and space.

This module assumes a rooted tree-shaped dependence structure.
For continuous time processes (as opposed to discrete time processes)
use the Markov jump process module instead.
Everything related to hold times, dwell times, instantaneous rates,
total rates, and edges or lengths or expectations associated with edges
is out of the scope of this module.

    """
    Compute a likelihood or raise an exception if the likelihood is zero.

    This is a general likelihood calculator for
    a Markov chain on tree-structured domains.
    At each node in the tree, the set of possible states may be restricted.
    Lack of state restriction at a node corresponds to missing data;
    a common example of such missing data would be missing states
    at internal nodes in a tree.
    Alternatively, a node could have a completely specified state,
    as could be the case if the state of the process is completely
    known at the tips of the tree.
    More generally, a node could be restricted to an arbitrary set of states.
    The first three args are used to construct a map from each node
    to a map from the state to the subtree likelihood,
    and the last arg defines the initial conditions at the root.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : undirected acyclic networkx graph
        A tree whose edges are annotated with transition matrices P.
    root : integer
        The root node.
    node_to_allowed_states : dict
        A map from a node to a set of allowed states.
    root_distn : dict, optional
        A sparse finite distribution or weights over root states.
        Values should be positive but are not required to sum to 1.
        If the distribution is not provided,
        then it will be assumed to have values of 1 for each possible state.
    P_default : directed weighted networkx graph, optional
        If an edge is not annotated with a transition matrix P,
        then this default transition matrix will be used.

    Returns
    -------
    likelihood : float
        The likelihood.
