    For each node, construct the map from state to subtree likelihood.

    This function allows each node to be restricted to its own
    arbitrary set of allowed states.
    Applications include likelihood calculation,

    for numerical reasons.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : undirected acyclic networkx graph
        A tree whose edges are annotated with transition matrices.
        The annotation uses the P attribute,
        and the transition matrices are themselves represented by
        networkx directed graphs with transition probabilities
        as the weight attribute of the edge.

    """
    Compute a likelihood.

    This is a general likelihood calculator for piecewise
    homegeneous Markov jump processes on tree-structured domains.
    At each node in the tree, the set of possible states may be restricted.
    Lack of state restriction at a node corresponds to missing data;
    a common example of such missing data would be missing states
    at internal nodes in a tree.
    Alternatively, a node could have a completely specified state,
    as could be the case if the state of the process is completely
    known at the tips of the tree.
    More generally, a node could be restricted to an arbitrary set of states.
    The first three args are used to construct a map from each node
    to a map from the state to the subtree likelihood,
    and the last arg defines the initial conditions at the root.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : undirected acyclic networkx graph
        A tree whose edges are annotated with transition matrices P.
    root : integer
        The root node.
    node_to_allowed_states : dict
        A map from a node to a set of allowed states.
    root_distn : dict
        A finite distribution over root states.

    -------
    likelihood : float
