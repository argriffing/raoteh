"""
Functions related to a Markov process in discrete time and space.

This module assumes a rooted tree-shaped dependence structure.
Transition probability matrices may be provided per edge,
and a default transition matrix may be provided which will be used
if an edge-specific transition matrix is not available.
The name of this module
is derived from "m"arkov "c"hain observation type "x",
where the observation type x refers to the least abstract of three
ways to deal with partial observations of the process state.
Type x uses a sparse map from nodes in the network
to their corresponding observed state if any.
Nodes missing from the map are assumed to have completely unobserved state,
while nodes in the map are assumed to have completely observed state.

Here are some more notes regarding the argument node_to_state.
Nodes in this map are assumed to have completely known state.
Nodes not in this map are assumed to have completely missing state.
If this map is not provided,
all states information will be assumed to be completely missing.
Entries of this dict that correspond to nodes not in the tree
will be silently ignored.
